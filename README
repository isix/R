# R code
R code for data analysis.
## Detailed Description
Here you can find R code that I have been collected along my career as 
Statistician and reasearcher. Some code was developed by myself, but
usually consist on code from other programmers adpted for my own
problems and/or day-by-day data analysis.
If you believe that a code belongs to you, and the author was not
properly cited, please let me know. My aim here is to share knowledge
as other people helped me to develop my own knowledge and skills.
I organized files by directories, and each dir a thema of data analysis.
